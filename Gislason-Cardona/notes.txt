12/21/16 intro chat

There is a paper already for B cenocepacia - ~400-500 essential genes (sounds about right)

The overall idea is to get a picked, reduced complexity library of rhamnose-dependent Tn mutants (the Tn has a rhamnose-inducible promoter on it)
  -Tns that have inserted upstream of an essential gene
  -Eventually they'll use this library to ID antibiotic targets (is a strain much more susceptible to the Ab with low/no rhamnose?)

Main problem here is they want to first ID the essential genome so they can tell if their library is right, and eventually if a mutant in this collection shows the phenotpe they want, what's the target gene?

Tnseq libraries:
2 runs of a 500k transconjugant library
  -high redundancy, wrong GC - I think April said this was run with Larry Gallagher's TnCircle method
ran again - 1m exconjugants, used Kapa polymerase for this one, better
  -120k/140k sites, but there are some cold spots...biological?
  -Ended up ID'ing 680ish essential genes with their in-house script - what's going wrong?

-April is using her own laptop for the work-
-Email April after the holidays - we'll work off a shared git repo and probably put the data in S3

1/23/17 - Keith and April catchup
-April has been able to upload files to S3 and get at the git repo
-GOAL of project is to run the essential script on their internal cepocepacia genome (K56-2)
-There are two seq runs, she'll upload the fastq files to S3
-She'll also upload a draft genome of their lab strain - 17 contigs, representing 3 chromosomes and one plasmid
  -Could represent a challenge for LOESS smoothing - can we scaffold?
    -The J2315 genome is the most closely related closed genome
    -PyScaf could work here: https://github.com/lpryszcz/pyScaf#reference-based-scaffolding
-Finally, she'll upload a little txt file with the transposon and primer seqs
-Keith will work as much as possible in the git repo so work is recorded
  -Spin up a new EC2 instance, clone this repo, run setup.sh to install required tools

## 2/20/17 - April - Keith
### K56-2 genome Genome assembly
- It's a PacBio, assembled with SMRT tools probably?
- 50 Gb file of PacBio reads!!
  - April will send me a link to an FTP host with it, also with shotgun Illumina
  - TODO - download to S3, investigate, reassemble, annotated with Prokka
  - 3 SMRT cells - 200x coverage - read N50 - 12k
- ASM98130v1 - should be a genome announcement of the old genome, check it out
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3798455/

### Which Tnseq libraries
- We'll figure it out later - does improving the genome make a difference?
  - Might need to think about using the lower density library since it has less bias

### Other stuff
- Tn has pRhamnose, trim ~20% from 5' end
