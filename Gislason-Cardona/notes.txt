There is a paper already for B cenocepacia - ~400-500 essential genes (sounds about right)

The overall idea is to get a picked, reduced complexity library of rhamnose-dependent Tn mutants (the Tn has a rhamnose-inducible promoter on it)
  -Tns that have inserted upstream of an essential gene
  -Eventually they'll use this library to ID antibiotic targets (is a strain much more susceptible to the Ab with low/no rhamnose?)

Main problem here is they want to first ID the essential genome so they can tell if their library is right, and eventually if a mutant in this collection shows the phenotpe they want, what's the target gene?

Tnseq libraries:
2 runs of a 500k transconjugant library
  -high redundancy, wrong GC - I think April said this was run with Larry Gallagher's TnCircle method
ran again - 1m exconjugants, Kapa method (?)
  -120k/140k sites, but there are some cold spots...biological?
  -Ended up ID'ing 680ish essential genes with their in-house script - what's going wrong?

-April is using her own laptop for the work-
-Email April after the holidays - we'll work off a shared git repo and probably put the data in S3
